I've used [GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/Kearns55/milestone-project-3/issues) to track and manage bugs and issues during the development stages of my project.

All previously closed/fixed bugs can be tracked [here](https://www.github.com/Kearns55/milestone-project-3/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug).

### Known Issues

| Issue | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| The project is designed to be responsive from `375px` and upwards, in line with the material taught on the course LMS. Minor layout inconsistencies may occur on extra-wide (e.g. 4k/8k monitors), or smart-display devices (e.g. Nest Hub, Smart Watches, Gameboy Color, etc.), as these resolutions are outside the project’s scope, as taught by Code Institute. | ![screenshot](documentation/issues/poor-responsiveness.PNG) |
| Validation errors on "signup.html" coming from the Django Allauth package. | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html-templates-signup.PNG) |

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of, though, even after thorough testing, I cannot rule out the possibility.
